Ole Schlichting Bachelorarbeit Projekt
This Repository is the Code for Benchmarking Kyber by creating a wrapper for liboqs, as well as RSA.

The "benchmark-programm.zip" contains the Programm used for Benchmarking.
It can be run using the CLI. When downloaded and unziped navigate into the folder. 
The Benchmarks can be run using the commands:
  Liboqs_implementation.exe benchmark kyber
  Liboqs_implementation.exe benchmark rsa
  Liboqs_implementation.exe benchmark rsa-7680
  Liboqs_implementation.exe benchmark rsa-15360

To get the sizes of Keys and Cipertext the following commands can be run
  Liboqs_implementation.exe sizes kyber
  Liboqs_implementation.exe sizes rsa
